# DataChain
A blockchain for storing data, 
A separate DataChain for each task for each Industry can be created which can interlink with each
other with full ownership of data to the owner only, authentication will be required everytime
other client wants to access required data.

Each asset will get a public key and cant be located by it on network, owner can decide the
amount of data to be kept in public domain and to be kept private.

The owner (who entered the data) of data has complete control over it with full privacy.

DataChain can be a private blockchain or public, depending on the requirements of Client.

Applications (Software's, websites, mobile app and etc) can access requested data by user
authentication and work with DataChain.
